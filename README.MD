# Recurring content detector / credits detector

This repository contains the code that was used to conduct experiments for a master's thesis LINK.

I also packed the used code up in a python package so that it can be reused more easily.

## Recurring content detection

With this code it is possible to detect recaps, opening credits, closing credits and previews up to a certain extent.
